Problem statement

Neural network model to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam 
based on two features: hours studied and prevoius exam scores. The dataset 
should contains information on hours studied and previous exam scores for a 
group of students, along with their exam outcomes (pass or fail).

Key Components of the Problem

1. Input Features

i)Hours Studied: This feature represents the number of hours a student dedicated
to studying for the exam. It is expected to have a direct correlation with the
likelihood of passing, as more study hours generally lead to better performance.

ii)Previous Exam Scores: This feature reflects the student's performance in past exams.
It provides insight into their academic ability or preparedness, which may influence
their success in future exams.

2. Target Variable
   
i)Exam Outcome: The binary label that represents whether the student passed or failed the
exam. It can be encoded as:
1 for Pass
0 for Fail

3. Dataset
   
i)The dataset should contain the following fields for a group of students:
Hours Studied: A numerical value for the number of hours spent studying.
Previous Exam Scores: A numerical value representing past performance.
Exam Outcome: A binary value indicating whether the student passed (1) or failed (0).

ii)The dataset needs to be representative and balanced, ensuring there is no significant skew
towards one class (pass or fail). Imbalanced data may lead to biased predictions.

4. Objective

The model will take the two input features (hours studied and previous exam scores) and predict 
the likelihood of passing or failing. This involves:

i)Learning the relationships between input features and the target variable.

ii)Generalizing well to predict outcomes for new, unseen students.

5. Challenges
   
i)Feature Interaction: The relationship between hours studied and previous exam scores may not be
linear, requiring the model to learn complex patterns.

ii)Data Quality: Noise in the data, such as inaccurate reporting of study hours or past scores, 
can affect model performance.

iii)Overfitting: The model may overfit the training data, especially if the dataset is small,
failing to generalize to unseen data.

iv)Class Imbalance: If most students in the dataset either pass or fail, the model might be biased 
towards predicting the majority class.

6. Model Design
   
i)Input Layer: Accepts the two features, hours studied and previous exam scores.

ii)Hidden Layers: Consist of neurons with activation functions (e.g., ReLU) to capture non-linear 
relationships between the features and the target variable.

iii)Output Layer: Contains a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function to output a probability 
value (between 0 and 1), which will be thresholded (e.g., at 0.5) to classify the outcome as 
pass or fail.

iv)Loss Function: Binary cross-entropy, as the task involves binary classification.

v)Optimizer: Adam optimizer or other gradient-based algorithms to minimize the loss function efficiently.

vi)Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC to assess model performance 
comprehensively.

7. Applications
   
This model could be useful in educational institutions to:

i)Identify at-risk students early and provide them with additional support or resources.

ii)Design personalized study plans based on predicted outcomes.

iii)Evaluate the impact of study habits on academic performance.
